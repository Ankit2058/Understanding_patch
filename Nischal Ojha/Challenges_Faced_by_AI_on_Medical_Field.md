# Challenges Faced by AI in the Medical Field

## Introduction
Recent progress in AI has led to effective solutions for many complex tasks. However, in the medical field, there are significant challenges that hinder the advancement of AI technologies.

## Challenges:

### 1. Unreliability and Trustworthiness of AI Technologies:
The scarcity of high-quality data for AI model training and evaluation can lead to inaccurate predictions, diagnoses, and biases in algorithms.

### 2. Privacy-Related Challenges
A recent United Kingdom survey reports that 63% of the adult population is uncomfortable with allowing personal data to be used to improve healthcare and is unfavorable to artificial intelligence (AI) systems replacing doctors and nurses in tasks they usually perform.
Data that is used to train algorithms must have the necessary use authorizations but determining which data uses are permitted for a given purpose is not an easy feat. This will also depend on data type, jurisdiction, purpose of use, and oversight models.

### 3. Lack of Awareness About AI Technologies
Many hospitals believe their doctors outperform AI systems.

### 4. Cultural Differences in Medical Treatment Approaches
Cultural preferences, such as Chinese patients favoring surgery over long-term management, create further challenges for AI systems designed with Western practices in mind.

### 5. Regional Challenges
AI systems like Watson, trained predominantly on Western medical data, struggle with China-specific disease profiles , such as:
- More hepatic diseases in China versus vascular diseases in the West.

### 6. Economic Challenges
The high cost of implementing AI systems poses a barrier for patients and hospitals.

### 7. Political, Legal, and Policy-Related Challenges
- Use of AI systems from foreign companies raises the fear of national security risks, such as vulnerability to biological warfare
- Treatment plans including the drugs approved in one country may not be approved in another country.

### 8. Data-Related Challenges
#### A. Insufficient Data Size
AI systems require large datasets for effective training, which are often unavailable.

#### B. Lack of Data Integration
Combining personal demographic information (e.g., age, gender) with clinical histories is crucial but rarely achieved.

### 9. Biased Data
One of the major red flags associated with AI is the potential for bias. Bias can occur for various reasons; for example, the data used to train AI applications — as well as the rules used to build algorithms — might be biased. Additionally, bias might occur because of a variance in the training data or environment and how the AI program or tool is applied in real life.

### 10. Black-Box Reasoning
Many of today’s cutting-edge AI technologies — particularly machine learning systems that offer great promise for transforming healthcare — have opaque algorithms, making it difficult or impossible to determine how they produce results. This unknown functioning is referred to as “black-box reasoning” or “black-box decision-making,” and it presents concerns for patient safety, clinical judgment, and liability.
